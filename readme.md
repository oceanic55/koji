KOJI AND KOJI STARTER

The preparation of good-quality koji is a fairly sensitive process requiring several pieces of special equipment (steamer and koji tray) that can be made or purchased without much difficulty. Don't be daunted: anyone can make good koji if he or she carefully follows the instructions given below, paying special attention to two basic points: 1) Keep your hands, all utensils, and the entire work area as clean as possible; 2) Keep the koji temperature within the recommended range throughout the 45-hour incubation period.
Most Japanese prepare koji at the same time of year they make miso, in the late fall or early spring, when the weather is cool and the number of contaminating microorganisms in the air is fairly low. The koji is generally prepared indoors in a room with a clean wooden floor. A typical batch calls for about 30 pounds of rice or barley so that the scale is considerably larger than in the following recipe. We have preferred to start with a smaller batch since the equipment is easier to obtain and you can easily increase all of the ingredients by as much as you like after your first small-scale success. The following recipe yields just enough koji for 1 medium-sized batch of Homemade Red Miso (p. 173). The amount of rice given just fills a typical steamer during one steaming.
To obtain a better perspective on the process of making koji, study the traditional miso shop method (Chapter 9), and to see how it fits into the integrated process of preparing Homemade Red Miso, study the flow chart in figure 33. The time schedule built into the following recipe ensures that all of the work can be done during ordinary waking hours. In all koji recipes, 1 pound of uncooked rice yields about 1.14 pounds of fresh koji. In the basic miso proportions on page 172, the weight of ready-made dried koji is the same as the weight of uncooked rice necessary to prepare fresh koji.

Utensils

A wooden koji tray about 16 by 10 by 2 1/2 inches deep with a lid consisting of 1 or 2 thin boards. Japanese trays are made of cedar (sugi), but Douglas fir, cherry, or pine also work well. Join boards with dowels or pegs to prevent rusting. A desk or bureau drawer, a cloth-lined enamel or stainless steel tray, or a shallow fruit box may also be used.
A 1-gallon soaking container
A 1 1/2- to 2-gallon kettle or wok. The kettle must have a flat rim and no handles rising above the rim to interfere with the steamer.
A 2- to 3-quart strainer or a cloth-lined colander
A square steamer (used with the kettle and easily made at home) or a round Chinese bamboo steamer with a woven bamboo lid (used with a wok and available at most Chinese hardware stores). Additional layers of steaming compartments may be added when using more than 6 to 8 cups of rice. The square steamer shown in figure 32 is made of 3/4-inch-thick cedar boards; it is 9 1/2 inches square and 4 1/2 inches deep inside. Two 3/4-inch-square boards near the bottom support a 9 1/2-inch square bamboo mat which forms the steamer's floor. The base is a 13-inch-square board with a 3/4-inch-diameter hole at the center. The steamer lid is composed of 2 boards reinforced on top to prevent buckling. An excellent Western-style steamer may also be improvised by placing a large colander atop several bricks or an inverted bowl inside an even larger kettle.
A steamer cloth made of coarsely-woven cotton or linen about 18 by 30 inches (or 24 inches square when used with the round steamer). Do not use ordinary dish-towel cloth; its relatively fine weave will not allow the passage of steam.
A wooden spatula or spoon
5 to 6 heavy-duty blankets (the oldest ones you have). A thick, flat cushion several feet square and a tarp may be substituted for 2 of them.
A clean linen sheet, or a piece of cotton cloth or gyoza mat of comparable size
A jar or bowl of several cups capacity
2 hot water bottles each wrapped in a small terrycloth towel or placed into a terrycloth sack with a drawstring mouth
2 thermometers (range 65°F to 130°F)
An incubation box, preferably one of sturdy cardboard about 20 by 12 by 14 inches deep. It must be slightly larger than the koji tray. Poke a 1/4-inch-diameter hole through lower left side of box, about 3 inches above the base.


Ingredients
Rice: Most rice koji (for amazaké and tsukemono as well as for miso) is prepared from short-grain white (milled or polished) rice, most modern makers believing that the bran layers of brown rice inhibit the penetration and growth of the mycelium. For a discussion of the basic techniques and difficulties of preparing brown-rice koji, see page 36. Beginning koji makers may wish to experiment with a koji midway between the white and brown varieties by removing 50 to 75 percent of the bran layers and cracking the kernels into several pieces, thereby exposing the soft inner carbohydrate core to mycelium growth. Rice is always steamed, never boiled, to make koji; the latter process creates a wet texture which encourages the growth of undesirable bacteria. One cup raw rice (7.24 oz) yields 1.80 cups (8.25 ounces) fresh koji.
Barley (O mugi, seimugi, hadakamugi): For basically the same reasons that white rice is generally used to make rice koji, pearled barley (whole grains of unrolled natural barley with the bran layers removed) is used to prepare barley koji and has been since ancient times. Barley contains slightly more protein, but slightly less carbohydrate and natural sugar than rice (fig. 34). Thus barley miso generally has a slightly higher nutritional value and is less sweet than rice miso. Other things being equal, the lack of sugars makes it necessary to ferment barley miso somewhat longer than rice miso.
Some miso makers prefer to use "naked" barley (hadakamugi) which is sometimes classified as a type of rye and yields miso with a unique aroma and flavor. It is also softer and free of the residual "centerline" and hull characteristic of polished regular barley (omugi) so that it gives the miso what many consider to be a more agreeable texture.

Other Koji Grains: In some traditional miso shops and many farmhouses, whole wheat is used to make koji for hishio and Kinzanji miso. Cornmeal is also used as the koji substrate in order to create a less expensive miso. In the Shinshu area, where the latter technique originated, cornmeal is soaked in water for 1 hour, steamed for 40 minutes, cooled to body temperature, and then inoculated with starter as for rice koji. In some areas rye, oats, millet, corn kernels and even sweet potatoes are used as the substrate.
Koji Starter (tané koji, koji kin): Koji starter is now available from several natural food suppliers in the United States (p. 258) or in small quantities from the Northern Regional Research Center (p. 259). The best source, Westbrae, buys koji starter from Nihon Jozo Kogyo in Japan (p. 258), the producer of eight basic types: one each for red-barley, and mellow barley miso; two for soybean miso; and three for sweet white miso. Each type is available in at least one of three different forms (whole-grain, meal, or spore powder) and some types are fortified with yeasts and Lactobacillus. Most starters are a mixture of pure-culture mold strains, each having different capabilities in breaking down proteins, carbohydrates, and oils. Among the total of 17 different varieties and forms produced by Nihon Jozo, those most widely available in North America are the spore-powder starters for red, barley, soybean and light-colored misos, and for shoyu. Each comes sealed in a foil envelope weighing about 1 1/2 ounces. Always keep starters well sealed in a refrigerator at 40°F to 59°F. Do not freeze.
All starter is olive green in color. The spore powder is 5 times as concentrated as the meal or whole grain forms and only 10 grams (1 tablespoon) are required to inoculate 110 pounds of (uncooked) rice. One tablespoon of the other two forms weighs 8.8 grams and will inoculate 19 pounds of rice. In cold weather or with small amounts of rice (less than 5 pounds), doubling the dosage of starter called for on the package yields good results.
If you already have a small amount of starter and wish to prepare more of your own see pages 182 and 249.
Homemade Rice Koji (Using Koji Starter)

6 1/4 cups (2.7 pounds) white rice
5/8 teaspoon (1.9 grams) spore powder koji starter or 1 1/2 teaspoons (4.4 grams) meal or whole-grain starter
1/4 cup (lightly roasted) white or whole-wheat flour

PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
Wash and scrub koji tray thoroughly, rinse with boiling water, and set upside-down to dry in a clean (sunny) place. Wash rice 3 or 4 times in soaking pot and soak for 12 to 16 hours in water to cover.
DAY 1:


8:00 a.m.: Fill kettle (or wok) two-thirds full of water and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, transfer soaked rice to a large strainer or cloth-lined colander, rinse under cold running water, and drain well. Rinse off steamer, insert bamboo mat, and line bottom and sides with moistened steamer cloth. Place steamer and base atop kettle (or place round steamer into wok) and pour rice into steamer to a depth of about 2 inches. (For large batches of koji, if all rice will not fit into one steamer layer, either add a second layer or steam rice in several consecutive batches.) Using wooden paddle or spoon, press rice firmly into corners of steamer and smooth rice surface (fig. 35a). Fold over ends of cloth to cover. When steam rises through rice, cover with lid (fig. b), and turn heat to medium-high. Steam for 50 minutes.


While rice is steaming, spread 2 blankets in a double layer atop a large table. Fold a clean sheet end to end and spread atop blankets. Combine the flour and koji starter in a small cup. Mix well, cover, and place on table near blankets. Fill a hot water bottle with boiling water; wrap in a small terrycloth towel or place in a towel sack.


Transfer hot steamed rice to center of sheet (fig. c). Using wooden paddle, mix rice thoroughly, breaking up all lumps, and spread to a depth of about 1 inch over a small area at the center of sheet. Insert thermometer into rice and wait several minutes until temperature drops to 113°F (45°C). Sprinkle one-half of the starter-flour mixture over rice and stir vigorously with paddle until starter spores are evenly distributed throughout grain. Sprinkle on remainder of starter mixture and stir, breaking up any remaining small lumps (fig. d).


Mound and pack inoculated rice into a hemisphere at center of sheet. Insert thermometer into rice and fold edges of sheet snugly over hemisphere to form a compact bundle (fig. e). Use the 2 blankets on the table to wrap bundle firmly, to minimize heat loss. Place hot water bottle atop another thick blanket folded into fourths (or a large flat cushion). Place bundled rice directly on top of hot water bottle and cover with at least two more thick blankets. Place this entire insulated "package" in a clean, out-of-the-way place, preferably one that is fairly warm. (Avoid locations near circulating air heaters; the Japanese set their koji on boards over a warm bath.)


Check rice temperature every 2 to 4 hours, seeing that it stays between 77°F and 95°F (25°C and 35°C). To raise the temperature, add fresh or additional hot water bottles and/or more blankets; to lower, transfer hot water bottle to below the bottom blanket and/or remove topmost blankets. Just before retiring, check temperature and insert a fresh hot water bottle (fig. f).


DAY 2:


8:00 a.m.: Check that koji temperature is within the range prescribed above. Adjust heat to bring temperature to about 95°F. Wash hands and open bundle. The young koji should now have a pleasant aroma, and individual grains should have a white, powder-like coating and be very loosely bound together by an almost invisible mycelium. If areas of bluish-green, black, or pink molds appear, carefully remove and discard. Now mix rice thoroughly and re-bundle.


10:00 a.m.: Check koji temperature, wash hands, and open bundle. Re-check aroma and appearance, then transfer koji from sheet to koji tray (fig. g). Mix koji, breaking up any small lumps. Shape koji into an oval mound (fig. h) 2 inches high at the highest points and slightly hollowed at the center. Insert one thermometer into koji and cover tray with lid(s). Put tray into incubation box; beside tray place 2 fresh hot water bottles and an uncovered jar of hot water (to keep air humidity at 90 percent to 95 percent). Set box atop 6 to 8 thicknesses of folded blankets (or 1 or 2 thick cushions). Insert the second thermometer into the hole poked through the side of box and cover box with 2 or 3 thick blankets (fig. i). Check box air temperature from time to time; try to keep it at 82°F, or at least within the range of 77°F to 91°F.


2:30 p.m.: Wash hands and check that koji temperature is between 80°F and 98°F. In no case should it be allowed to fall below 77°F or rise above 104°F. Stir koji quickly but thoroughly in order to break up lumps (which can cause overheating), aid circulation, and ensure even mycelium growth. Remound koji into oval volcano shape, re-cover tray with lid set slightly ajar, and re-cover incubation box with blankets.


6:00 p.m.: Check that temperature inside koji is within the range prescribed above. Stir koji thoroughly and spread it in an even layer (about 1 inch deep) over entire bottom of tray. Re-cover tray with lid set well ajar. Replenish hot water bottles and hot water in jar. (Begin to soak soybeans as described in the basic homemade miso recipe given on page 173.)


10:00 p.m. (or just before retiring): Check that koji temperature is between 85°F and 96°F. If necessary, replenish hot water bottles.


DAY 3:

11:00 a.m. (after 45 hours of incubation): Open box and examine koji for doneness. The individual rice grains should now be bound together with a delicate mycelium of fragrant white mold. Break open several grains (they should be soft enough to break easily) and check that the white mycelium roots have penetrated at least two-thirds of the way to the grain's center.

(If koji has a bluish-green color and a moldy or musty odor, sporulation has begun due to over-fermentation. If koji is black and slightly damp, contaminating molds have begun to grow due to overheating. In either case, place koji in a large colander, douse several times with hot water to wash off undesirable microorganisms, and re-incubate. Or discard koji and start again.)

Stir finished koji thoroughly, remove tray from incubation box and place in a cool, clean location for about 1/2 hour, or until koji temperature drops to room temperature. Measure into a large pot the amount of koji called for in the recipe you wish to prepare: a medium-sized batch of red miso, for example, requires 2 pounds 12 ounces times 1.14, or about 3 pounds 2 ounces. Mix this fresh koji with the amount of salt called for in your miso recipe, then proceed to mix with the cooked soybeans as described in variation 3 of the basic recipe for Homemade Red Miso (p. 175).

If any koji remains, transfer it to a separate container, seal well, and refrigerate; reserve for use in making amazaké or koji pickles (p. 162), or additional batches of miso.
STORING KOJI
If for some reason you cannot use the koji immediately, spread it in a thin layer on sheets of newspaper and allow to dry for 10 to 20 hours in a clean, warm place. Then seal and store in a cool, dry place. It will keep for 1 to 2 months in good condition, or for as long as 6 months, but with a slight decline in flavor and potency.
For even longer storage, spread the (plain or salted) koji on a clean sheet in direct sunlight (or on baking tins in a 113°F oven) until thoroughly dried. Sealed and stored in a cool, dry place, it will last for up to 1 year.

Homemade Brown Rice Koji
Soak and steam very lightly polished brown rice as described above for white rice. To prevent the growth of alien microorganisms, regulate the koji temperature very carefully, keeping it about 5°F below the average temperature when using white rice. Otherwise the process is the same.
Homemade Barley Koji MAKES 3.5 POUNDS (12.5 CUPS) (Using Koji Starter)
To make enough fresh koji for one medium-sized batch of Homemade Barley Miso (p. 175) simply substitute polished (pearled) barley for white rice in the basic koji recipe. Prepare as for Homemade Fresh Koji except: 1) Soak the barley for only 2 to 3 hours. 2) Steam the barley for 90 minutes or until the grain becomes somewhat transparent and slightly rubbery. 3) For best results try to remove the incubating koji when the mycelium is pure white, after about 36 hours. A yellow mycelium is also satisfactory but will yield a sweeter miso. A black mycelium is unsatisfactory.
Homemade Rice or Barley Koji (Prepared Without Koji Starter)
Preparing this koji using wild mold spores is analogous to making sourdough bread without starter. The best results are obtained in areas where the air is clear and somewhat cold, or in places such as miso shops or rooms where miso is fermenting where there are large numbers of free Aspergillus oryzae mold spores in the atmosphere.
In Japan, it is said that the air is much more free of undesirable organisms (that could produce toxins in fermenting koji) than most air in the U.S. or other parts of the West. Thus, unless you live in an area where the air is very clean and preferably, cold, it is better to use koji starter.
Soak and steam the rice or barley as for Homemade Rice or Barley Koji. Spread the steamed grain on a sheet and allow to stand uncovered overnight so that it "catches" wild mold spores floating in the air. Transfer grain to the koji tray and spread it in an even layer over the bottom. Place tray in incubation box and proceed as for Homemade Rice Koji. Harvest the koji after about 3 to 4 days when it is covered with a white or light-yellow mycelium.
Homemade Koji Starter
Please begin by studying the commercial process for preparing koji starter (p. 233). The best starter is prepared from homemade koji incubated under carefully controlled conditions of temperature, humidity, and cleanliness. If contaminating microorganisms enter the koji, and the koji is then made into starter, their negative effect is multiplied. Starter can also be prepared from commercial koji, but the chances of obtaining a high degree of purity are somewhat less than with the homemade variety. Traditional Japanese homemade miso was generally started either by wild mold spores (described above) or by incubating a portion of each batch of homemade koji for 5 to 7 days, until the molds sporulated, then drying the product thoroughly and storing it for later use as starter. This latter process, known as the "cut-and-dry" method, was generally carried out without the use of brown rice or wood ash now used commercially—and good results were obtained.
To make your own starter, place about 1/2 cup finished homemade koji in a small wooden bowl, return it to the incubator, and keep at the same temperatures required for the commercial process until the mycelium turns from white to a soft olive green. Crumble, dry in a warm oven as described, and store sealed in a cool, dry place. Use as for whole-grain starter.
HOMEMADE MISO (Using Homemade Koji)
In the following recipes, the preparation of the koji is an integral part of the miso-making process.
Homemade Hatcho or Soybean Miso
MAKES 6.4 POUNDS (10.6 CUPS)
We have had excellent results with this recipe. The key lies in keeping the temperature below 100°F, lest contaminating microorganisms begin to propagate and turn the soybeans into sticky natto. Some makers prefer to use a special soybean koji starter, however the regular starter used for rice or barley miso also works well. Please begin by studying the process for Homemade Rice Koji (p. 179), which the following recipe closely resembles, and the process for Commercial Hatcho Miso (p. 210).

8 cups (3 1/4 pounds) whole dry soybeans, soaked for 10 hours and drained
1/2 teaspoon (1.5 grams) spore-powder koji starter or 1 1/2 teaspoons (4.4 grams) meal- or whole-grain starter
5 tablespoons (lightly roasted) white or whole-wheat flour
1 cup (10.4 ounces) salt (increase to 1 1/4 cups if aging miso for 2 years or more)
2 cups mixing liquid (boiled water)
4 tablespoons Hatcho or soybean miso

Place beans in a large steamer (p. 177) and steam for 6 hours, or until individual beans are soft enough to crush easily between the thumb and small finger. Combine starter and flour in a small bowl, mixing well. Cool beans to body temperature, then transfer onto a clean sheet and sprinkle with half the flour-starter mixture. Stir beans thoroughly with a wooden spoon, then sprinkle on the rest of the mixture and re-stir until each bean is covered with the inoculum.
Transfer inoculated beans into koji tray and place into incubation box with hot water bottles and water-filled jar as for Homemade Rice Koji. Keep air temperature inside box as close as possible to 86°F (and within the range of 79°F to 89°F), and stir following the same schedule as for Homemade Rice Koji. If the temperature rises above 100°F or if the beans become sticky, immediately remove hot water bottles and jar and open lid of box until temperature and humidity drop. Then return 1 water bottle but do not return jar for at least 4 hours, or until stickiness has disappeared. Continue incubating for 40 to 50 hours, or until beans are bound together by a dense mat of fragrant white mycelium. Mash or grind two-thirds of the soybean koji and combine in a large mixing pot with the salt, mixing liquid and mature miso; mix well. Transfer to vat, cover with sealing sheet and pressing lid, and top with weights: for Hatcho miso, use a weight equal to that of the fermenting mixture; for regular soybean miso, use one-third to one-fourth the weight. Allow to stand at the natural temperature of the environment for at least 12 months or, for best flavor, for 18 months or more, including two full summers.
